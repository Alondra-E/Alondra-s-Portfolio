### Blue Bottle Coffee Analysis
**Code:** [blue_bottle_coffee_code.py](https://github.com/Alondra-E/Alondra-s-Portfolio/blob/main/blue_bottle_coffee_code.py)


**Goal**: Leveraging Data for Competitive Advantage.

**Description:** Developed visual insights in Python to support data-driven decisions for market expansion. Built predictive models using logistic regression and decision trees to improve targeting strategies. Analyzed salary data to identify high-income customers and where they reside for the ideal locations for business growth.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, Predictive modeling, Machine learning, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, LabelEncoder, train_test_split, DecisionTreeClassifier, accuracy_score, ConfusionMatrixDisplay, confusion_matrix, BaggingClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, preprocessing, LogisticRegression, metrics

**Results:** Using Machine learning and Python functions the analysis revealed that best location for profit would be near University neighborhoods. A marketing strategy would be a Student discount/special.
